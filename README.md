### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am research assistant in Neural Engineering :brain::computer:. I hold a MSc and BSc in Electronic Engineering from the University of Udine, Italy, where I was also part of the excellence program "Scuola Superiore".

I am interested in computational and theoretical methods to better understand how to integrate neurons and computers. Always looking forward to new projects and ideas! You can reach me on:
